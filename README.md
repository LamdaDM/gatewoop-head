# About
Gatewoop-head is an **unfinished** (and will most likely remain unfinished) web service created for fun, and for educational purposes, as it was my first attempt at developing a web service. Gatewoop is intended to be a forum/social-media platform, with optional anonymity and exclusive group-owned boards, as an alternative to existing platforms such as facebook (Gatewoop? Facebook? Get it?).

It uses the first Trunk prototype (called Trunker) for logging and hashing, Redis for caching and MySQL for persistence.
